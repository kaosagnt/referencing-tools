<strong>REFERENCE LIST ENTRY</strong>
<br>
<br>
Avoid where possible! 
<br>
<br>
It is better to refer back to the original source yourself so you can check the accuracy of the 
quoted material. If the original source is unavailable, use cited in. The original authors are 
named in your text, but only the source you actually read goes in the reference list. For example, 
if a study by Jones and Chan was quoted in a work that you read by Smith, you would only list Smith 
in your reference list.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
Name the original authors and use &#8216;cited in&#8217; to refer to the secondary work you read. 
For example, a study by Jones was quoted in a work by Smith, but you did not read the study by Jones. 
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Jones (cited in Smith, 2009) agreed that the experiment failed to confirm this hypothesis.
	<br>
	or
	<br>
	The experiment failed to confirm this hypothesis (Jones, cited in Smith, 2009).
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
If you directly quote fewer than 30 words, enclose the quotation using single quotation marks and
include the page number(s).
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Jones (cited in Smith 2009, p. 56) observed that &#8216;students perform better when rested&#8217;. 
	<br>
	Alternatively: Therefore, &#8216;students perform better when rested&#8217; (Jones, cited in 
	Smith 2009, p. 56).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 30 words it should be displayed in a double&#45;spaced, indented block
(1.3cm) without quotation marks.
