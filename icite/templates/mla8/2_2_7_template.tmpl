<strong>WORKS CITED</strong>
<br><br>
Avoid where possible!
<br><br>
It is better to refer back to the original source yourself so you can check the accuracy of the quoted material. If the original source is unavailable, use &#8216;quoted in&#8217; (or &#8216;qtd. in&#8217; in a parenthetical citation). The original authors are named in your text, but only the source you actually read goes in the Works Cited list. For example, if material by Jones and Chan was quoted in a work that you read by Smith, you would only list Smith in your Works Cited.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br><br>
In parentheses, name the original authors, followed by &#8216;qtd. in&#8217;, and then the author(s) and relevant page numbers from the secondary work you read. For example, material by Jones and Chan was quoted in a work by Smith, but you did not read the work by Jones and Chan.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	&hellip;was found to be the case (Jones and Chan qtd. in Smith 25&#45;26).
</blockquote>
<br>
Or include the original authors in your sentence, with the secondary author and relevant page 
number(s) in parentheses.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Jones and Chan suggested that &#34;the default position is markedly affected&#34; 
	(qtd. in Smith 23).
