<strong>WORKS CITED</strong>
<br><br>
Add a &#8216;Works Cited&#8217; entry at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br><br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br><br>
If the brochure is authored, include the name of the author at the start of the Works Cited entry followed by the title. If the author and publisher are the same, begin the entry with the title. 
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent">
	<em>Title</em>. Publisher, year of publication. 
</blockquote>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong>
<br><br>
Abbreviate <em>University</em> to <em>U</em>.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br><br>
When you use another person&#8217;s ideas in your writing, list the author&#8217;s name, in parentheses, immediately following the cited material. If the entry begins with the title, provide the title of the brochure in italics. Abbreviate the title if it is longer than a noun phrase. For example, <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Southern Novels</em> consists entirely of a noun phrase (a noun <em>Novels</em> preceded by two modifiers) and wouldn&#8217;t be shortened. By contrast <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels of the South</em> would be shortened to its noun phrase <em>Faulkner’s Novels</em>. The abbreviated title should begin with the word by which it is alphabetised in the Works Cited. If the title does not begin with a noun phrase, cite the first word if it is enough to direct the reader to the correct entry. For further information on abbreviating titles, see 3.2.1 in the <a href="http://west-sydney-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UWS-ALMA:default_scope:UWS-ALMA21186157620001571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLA Handbook (8th edition)</a>.
