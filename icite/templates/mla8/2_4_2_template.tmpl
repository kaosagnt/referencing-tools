<strong>WORKS CITED</strong>
<br><br>
Add a &#8216;Works Cited&#8217; entry at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br><br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br><br>
If the source does not include a publication date, omit the date and include an access date at the end of the Works Cited entry. If you have found the date from a reliable external source, place the date in square brackets to show that the date did not come from the source. If there is uncertainty about the date, place a question mark after the date. For further information, see 2.6.1 in the <a href="http://west-sydney-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UWS-ALMA:default_scope:UWS-ALMA21186157620001571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLA Handbook (8th edition)</a>.

<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent">
	<em>Title of the page</em>. Organisation or publisher of site, URL. Access date.  
</blockquote>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent">
	<em><span class="hover" title="Title of the page">Statistics New Zealand</span>.</em> 
	<span class="hover" title="Organisation or publisher of site">New Zealand Government</span>,
	<span class="hover" title="Date of access">26 Sep. 2044</span>,

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br><br>
In a parenthetical citation, when the author is anonymous, include the title of the web page in italics, immediately following the cited material. Abbreviate the title if it is longer than a noun phrase. For example, <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Southern Novels</em> consists entirely of a noun phrase (a noun <em>Novels</em> preceded by two modifiers) and wouldnâ€™t be shortened. By contrast <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels of the South</em> would be shortened to its noun phrase <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels</em>. The abbreviated title should begin with the word by which it is alphabetised in the Works Cited. If the title does not begin with a noun phrase, cite the first word if it is enough to direct the reader to the correct entry. For further information on abbreviating titles, see 3.2.1 Abbreviating Titles of Sources in the <a href="http://west-sydney-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UWS-ALMA:default_scope:UWS-ALMA21186157620001571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLA Handbook (8th edition)</a>.

Or include the title in your sentence, with the relevant page number(s) in parentheses.
