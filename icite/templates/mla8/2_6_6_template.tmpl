<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br><br>
When referring to an artwork in your writing, it may be useful to include the title in italics as well as the authorâ€™s name in the sentence.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In <em>Kitchen Sink Daydreams</em>, Smith demonstrates&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
In a parenthetical citation, abbreviate the title if it is longer than a noun phrase. For example, <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Southern Novels</em> consists entirely of a noun phrase (a noun <em>Novels</em> preceded by two modifiers) and wouldn&#8217;t be shortened. By contrast <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels of the South</em> would be shortened to its noun phrase <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels</em>. The abbreviated title should begin with the word by which it is alphabetised in the Works Cited. If the title does not begin with a noun phrase, cite the first word if it is enough to direct the reader to the correct entry. For further information on abbreviating titles, see 3.2.1 in the <a href="http://west-sydney-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UWS-ALMA:default_scope:UWS-ALMA21186157620001571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLA Handbook (8th edition)</a>.
