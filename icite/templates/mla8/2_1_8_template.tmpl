<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br><br>
When information or ideas are sourced from two or more different works, cite each work as you normally would, with the works listed in alphabetical order and separated by a semi&#45;colon.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	&hellip;was found to be the case (Brown 34; Jones 123).
	<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
If the title of the book is included in the citation, provide the title in italics. If you are citing a chapter title, place the title in double quotation marks.
<br><br>
In a parenthetical citation, abbreviate the title if it is longer than a noun phrase. For example, <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Southern Novels</em> consists entirely of a noun phrase (a noun <em>Novels</em> preceded by two modifiers) and wouldnâ€™t be shortened. By contrast <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels of the South</em> would be shortened to its noun phrase <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels</em>. If the title does not begin with a noun phrase, cite the first word if it is enough to direct the reader to the correct entry. For further information on abbreviating titles, see 3.2.1 in the <a href="http://west-sydney-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UWS-ALMA:default_scope:UWS-ALMA21186157620001571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLA Handbook (8th edition)</a>.

</blockquote>
<br>
When the author is referred to more than once in the same paragraph only the page number is needed for subsequent citations, as long as the work cannot be confused with others cited.
