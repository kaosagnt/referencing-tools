<strong>WORKS CITED</strong>
<br><br>
Add a &#8216;Works Cited&#8217; entry at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br><br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br><br>
If you are writing about an episode in a series that does not focus on one particular individual&#8217;s contribution, begin the entry with the episode title followed by the contributor&#8217;s name and their descriptive label. If a contributor did not play the role in the entire series, identify such a contributor after the title of the episode, rather than after the series. 
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent">
	&#34;Title of episode (if available).&#34; Name(s) of contributors and descriptive label for each contributor for episode. <em>Title of Series</em>, name(s) of contributors and descriptive label for each contributor for series, season number, episode number, name of network, production or distribution company, date or year of broadcast. Description.

If the discussion of your work focuses on the role of a particular person, begin the Works Cited entry with their name followed by a descriptive label. Information on other key participants can be included in the position of other contributors.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br><br>
When a work is listed by the episode title in the Works Cited list, place double quotation marks around the title in the sentence.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	&#34;Six of One&#34; demonstrates&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
In a parenthetical citation, abbreviate the title if is longer than a noun phrase, immediately following the cited material. For example, <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Southern Novels</em> consists entirely of a noun phrase (a noun <em>Novels</em> preceded by two modifiers) and wouldnâ€™t be shortened. By contrast <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels of the South</em> would be shortened to its noun phrase <em>Faulkner&#8217;s Novels</em>. The abbreviated title should begin with the word by which it is alphabetised in the Works Cited. If the title does not begin with a noun phrase, cite the first word if it is enough to direct the reader to the correct entry. For further information on abbreviating titles, see 3.2.1 in the <a href="http://west-sydney-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UWS-ALMA:default_scope:UWS-ALMA21186157620001571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLA Handbook (8th edition)</a>.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	&hellip;a sense of heightened emotion (&#34;Six&#34;).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the Works Cited entry begins with the name of a contributor, use the contributor(s) name whenever you refer to the source in your writing. Descriptive labels (e.g. performer) is not required in-text.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Walter demonstrates&hellip;
	<br><br>
	Or
	<br><br>
	&hellip;a sense of heightened emotion (Walters).
</blockquote>
<br>
Since page numbers cannot be given to direct your reader, when referring to a specific part of an episode, describe the scene or what was discussed as accurately and concisely as possible.
