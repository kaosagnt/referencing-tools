	<strong>THE PRIVACY ACT</strong>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Russell suggests that there comes a time in the life of most individuals when the need for personal 
space or privacy becomes an important issue (69). Otto and Brown concur, citing the Taog Niatnuom 
mountain dwellers in the highlands of New Guinea, who have developed a set of strategies for 
encouraging their offspring to develop individualism (234). This point is further elucidated in 
Crosby: &#34;local haunts are earmarked for the particular and personal use of their kids&#34; (456). 
However, where some societies organise initiation ceremonies involving mutilation and dismemberment 
of bodily organs, the Taog Niatnuom progeny, upon reaching puberty, are allotted their own special 
places for the storage of treasures and the whispering of secrets. These storage compounds have 
revealed to archaeologists a minefield of long&#45;forgotten follies, enabling the systematic and 
chronological development of the Taog Niatnuom to be scientifically analysed from infancy through 
adolescence to adulthood (O&#8217;Carroll and Brown 34; Mozart and Brown 779).

In contrast, Smith comments that in more westernised societies, the privacy of progeny is a taboo 
issue: parents reject the idea of their kids harbouring secret devices and desires seeing these as 
a threat, a danger to family stability or even universal democracy. Some parents have been known to 
read cherished diaries hidden under mattresses, or follow up trails of unaccountable periodic 
disappearances into the realms of phantasia (<em>Exploring Nanoscale Science</em> 57). Aoyama 
et al. agree and cite the example of Doug who resided with his family in a green and leafy suburb 
in a far&#45;flung colonial outpost. Doug&#8217;s journey through adolescence manifested itself in an 
obsessive desire, indeed almost disorder, for the closeting of his innermost secrets and stashes; 
a behavioural trait that was thwarted by his parents and three older brothers (357). Naan Blearey 
his mother, infuriated by the frantic and constant digging up of her precious snapdragons in the 
front garden, acknowledged &#34;By the judicious use of slingshots and catapults I eventually 
forced Doug into burying his bones in the laundry under the enormous piles of dirty washing&#34; 
(Personal communication 31 Feb. 2057).
