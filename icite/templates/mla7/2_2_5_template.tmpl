<strong>WORKS CITED</strong>

<br>
Add a &#8216;Works Cited&#8217; entry at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of 
your writing.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br>
<blockquote>
	<div class="ref-hang-indent">
		Author&#8217;s name. &#34;Title of Article.&#34; <em>Name of Publication</em> 
		volume.issue (year of publication): page numbers. Medium of publication.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
When you use another person&#8217;s ideas or words in your writing, include their name and any 
relevant page number(s), in parentheses, immediately following the cited material. If there are 
two or more works by the same author, also include the title (shortened if necessary).
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	&hellip;was found to be the case (Smith, &#34;Teaming with Wildlife&#34; 235&#45;36).
</blockquote>
<br>
Or include the author&#8217;s name in your sentence, with the relevant page number(s) in parentheses.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith suggests that &#34;the default position is markedly affected&#34; (&#34;Teaming with Wildlife&#34; 
	237).
</blockquote>
<br>
When the author is referred to more than once in the same paragraph only the page number is 
needed for subsequent citations, as long as the work cannot be confused with others cited.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	&hellip;was found to be the case (Smith, &#34;Teaming with Wildlife&#34; 235&#45;36). 
	In addition&hellip; was a common feature (237).
