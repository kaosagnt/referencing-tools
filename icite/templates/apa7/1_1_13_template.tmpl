<strong>REFERENCE LIST ENTRY</strong>
<br>
<br>
Add a reference list at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br>
<br>
If a DOI is available, include the DOI at the end of the reference list.
<br>
<br>
For works without a DOI, if the work was accessed from a website (excluding online academic research 
databases, e.g., ProQuest, EBSCO and ScienceDirect) include the URL in the reference. Works accessed 
from an academic database do not require a URL or detail about the database in the reference list. In 
this case, the work would be referenced in the same manner as a print version of the work. URLs and DOIs 
are displayed as a hyperlink. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Format (with DOI)</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	Author(s). (Year of publication). <em>Title of book</em>. DOI
</blockquote>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	<span class="hover" title="Author(s)">Brown, R</span>. 
	(<span class="hover" title="Year of publication">2020</span>). 
	<em><span class="hover" title="Title of book">The death of CDs: Impact of the MP3 player</span></em>. 
	<span class="hover fake-aref" title="DOI">https://doi.org/10.1036/0071393756</span>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
If the source displays the DOI number only (e.g., 10.1036/0071393756), convert the DOI into a link by 
adding <span class="fake-aref">https://doi.org/</span> before the number.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise
<br>
<br>
<strong>Format (from a database)</strong>
<br>

<br>
When the author is referred to more than once, in the same paragraph, cite the work the first time 
that it is referred to in your writing. Once the work is cited, it is not necessary to include the 
citation again, as long as it is clear that you are referring to the same work and that it cannot 
be confused with other sources being paraphrased. Repeat the citation again, if the paraphrase 
continues into the next paragraph.  
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent study, Brown (2020) showed that&hellip; Brown also found that&hellip;

<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using

	(Brown, 2020, p. 26).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
