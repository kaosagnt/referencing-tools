</blockquote>
<br>
When the director is referred to more than once, in the same paragraph, cite the work the first time 
that it is referred to in your writing. Once the work is cited, it is not necessary to include the 
citation again, as long as it is clear that you are referring to the same work and that it cannot 
be confused with other sources being paraphrased. Repeat the citation again, if the paraphrase 
continues into the next paragraph.

<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent study, Jones (2020) showed that&hellip; Jones also found that&hellip;

<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, provide a time stamp for the beginning of the quotation 
in place of a page number.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Jones (2020) stated that&hellip; (17:12).
	<br>
	Alternatively: &hellip; (Jones, 2020, 17:12).
