<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
When citing a work that has no author, provide the title, in italics, and the year. If the title is 
long, use a shortened form of the title. Capitalise titles using title case (the first letter of all 
major words is capitalised) even though the title in the reference list is presented in sentence case 
(first letter of first word in the title and subtitle is capitalised). 
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	<em>Swim with Whales</em> (2018) suggests that&hellip;
	<br>
	Alternatively: &hellip;are among the activities (<em>Swim with Whales</em>, 2018).
</blockquote>
<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using 
double quotation marks. As webpages do not usually contain page numbers, include either a heading 
or section name, a paragraph number or a combination of a section name with a paragraph number in 
lieu of page numbers.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	<em>Swim with Whales</em> (2018) observed that &#34;Australian Orca whales are largely unaffected&#34; 
	(Population Information).
	<br>
	Alternatively: Fortunately, &#34;Australian Orca whales are largely unaffected&#34; 
	(<em>Swim with Whales</em>, 2018, para. 5).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to cite an <strong>entire website</strong>, without mentioning particular information 
from a specific webpage, it is not necessary to include the website in your reference list. Instead, 
provide the URL in parentheses.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Workcover is a useful work health and safety website for information and documents about 
	addiction (<span class="fake-aref">http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/newlegislation2012/Pages/default.aspx</span>).
