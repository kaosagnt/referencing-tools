<strong>REFERENCE LIST ENTRY</strong>
<br>
<br>
Add a reference list at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	Author. (Year, Month Day of publication). Title of article. 
	<em>Name of Newspaper</em>, page number(s).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the work was accessed from a website (excluding online academic research databases, 
e.g., ProQuest, EBSCO and ScienceDirect) include the URL, displayed as an active link, 
at the end of the reference. Works accessed from an academic database do not require a URL 
or detail about the database in the reference list. In this case, the work would be referenced 
in the same manner as a print version of the work.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	<span class="hover" title="Author">Smith, A.</span> 
	(<span class="hover" title="Year, Month Day of publication">2017, December 15</span>). 
	<span class="hover" title="Title of article">Something went wrong in plane crash, experts say</span>. 
	<em><span class="hover" title="Name of Newspaper">Herald Tribune</span></em>, 
	<span class="hover" title="page number">A5</span>.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith (2017) indicated that&hellip;
	<br>
	Alternatively: A recent article (Smith, 2017) showed that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
When the author is referred to more than once, in the same paragraph, cite the work the first 
time that it is referred to in your writing. Once the work is cited, it is not necessary to include 
the citation again, as long as it is clear that you are referring to the same work and that it cannot 
be confused with other sources being paraphrased. Repeat the citation again, if the paraphrase 
continues into the next paragraph.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent article, Smith (2017) showed that&hellip; Smith also found that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using 
double quotation marks and include page numbers.
<br>
<br>
If the title is included in the text, when the title is long, the first few words should be used. 
If the title is not italicised in the reference list, place double quotation marks around the title 
of the article and capitalise using title case (the first letter of each major word is capitalised), 
even though sentence case (the first letter of the first word only, in the main title and subtitle, 
is capitalised) is used in the reference list.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In his article &#34;Something Went Wrong&#34;, Smith (2017) revealed that &#34;pilot error was 
	most likely the cause&#34; (p. 4).
	<br>
	Alternatively: &#34;Pilot error was most likely the cause&#34; (Smith, 2017, p. 4).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
