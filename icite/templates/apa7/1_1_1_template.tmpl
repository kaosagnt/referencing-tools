<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
If you are citing a work which has no author, the first few words of the title may be used. The 
title of the book is italicised and capitalised using title case (the first letter of each major 
word is capitalised), even though sentence case (the first letter of the first word only, in the 
main title and subtitle, is capitalised) is used in the reference list.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	A recent study (<em>Illustrated Dictionary</em>, 2017) suggests that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using double 
use quotation marks and include page numbers.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	The <em>Illustrated Dictionary</em> (2017) states that &#34;chocolate has several health benefits&#34; 
	(p. 56).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
