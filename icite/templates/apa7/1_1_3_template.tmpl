<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
Where a work has two authors, cite both names every time the reference occurs in the text.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith and Brown (2017) indicated that&hellip;
	<br>
	Alternatively: A recent study (Copstead &amp; Banasik, 2005) showed that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
When the author is referred to more than once, in the same paragraph, cite the work the first 
time that it is referred to in your writing. Once the work is cited, it is not necessary to include 
the citation again, as long as it is clear that you are referring to the same work and that it cannot 
be confused with other sources being paraphrased. Repeat the citation again, if the paraphrase 
continues into the next paragraph.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent study, Smith and Brown (2017) showed that&hellip; Smith and Brown also found 
	that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using 
double quotation marks and include page numbers.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith and Brown (2017) observe that &#34;our dependency on oil is a growing concern&#34; (p. 34).
	<br>
	Alternatively: In terms of sustainability, &#34;our dependency on oil is a growing concern&#34; 
	(Smith &amp; Brown, 2017, p. 34).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
