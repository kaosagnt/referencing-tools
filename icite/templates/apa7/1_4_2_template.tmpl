<strong>REFERENCE LIST ENTRY</strong>
<br>
<br>
Add a reference list at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	Author(s). (Year of publication). <em>Title of webpage</em>. URL
</blockquote>
<br>
If content is likely to change over time, include a retrieval date before the URL. Use n.d. for 
&#8216;no date&#8217; if the publication date is not available. When the author and website name 
are different, include the website name after the title of the webpage.
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	Author. (n.d.). <em>Title of webpage</em>. Website Name. Retrieved Month Day, Year, from URL
</blockquote>
<br>
When the author and the website name are the same, omit the website name from the reference.
<br>
<br>

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>

<br>
When the author is referred to more than once, in the same paragraph, cite the work the first 
time that it is referred to in your writing. Once the work is cited, it is not necessary to include 
the citation again, as long as it is clear that you are referring to the same work and that it cannot 
be confused with other sources being paraphrased. Repeat the citation again, if the paraphrase 
continues into the next paragraph.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent study, Smith and Brown (2019) showed that &hellip; Smith and Brown also found 
	that &hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using 
double quotation marks. As webpages do not usually contain page numbers, include either a heading 
or section name, a paragraph number, or a combination of a section name with a paragraph number 
in lieu of page numbers.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith and Brown (2019) report that &#34;the facility is very popular amongst the community&#34; 
	(Conclusion).
	<br>
	Alternatively: As a result, &#34;the facility is very popular amongst the community&#34; 
	(Smith &amp; Brown, 2019, para. 25).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to cite an <strong>entire website</strong>, without mentioning particular information 
from a specific webpage, it is not necessary to include the website in your reference list. Instead, 
provide the URL in parentheses.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Workcover is a useful work health and safety website for information and documents about 
	addiction (<span class="fake-aref">http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/newlegislation2012/Pages/default.aspx</span>).
