<h2>%%ReferenceStyle%%Book, one source quoted in another</h2>

<br>
Avoid where possible!
<br>
<br>
It is better to refer back to the original source yourself so you can check the accuracy of the 
quoted material. If the original source is unavailable, use <strong>&#8216;as cited in&#8217;</strong> 
in your text. The original authors, and year if known, are named in your text, but only the source you 
actually read goes in the reference list. For example, if a study by Jones and Chan was quoted in a 
work that you read by Smith, you would only list Smith in your reference list.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
Name the original authors, and year if known, and use &#8216;as cited in&#8217; to refer to the 
secondary work you read. For example, a study by Jones and Chan was quoted in a work by Smith, but 
you did not read the study by Jones and Chan.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	A recent study (Jones &amp; Chan, 2015, as cited in Smith, 2017) showed &hellip;
	<br>
	Alternatively: Webber and Reed (2010, as cited in Smith, 2017) indicated that&hellip;

<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using double 
quotation marks and include page numbers.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Webber and Reed (as cited in Smith, 2017) observed that &#34;students perform better when rested&#34; 
	(p. 56).
	<br>
	Alternatively: Therefore, &#34;students perform better when rested&#34; (Jones &amp; Chan, 2015, as 
	cited in Smith, 2017, p. 56).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
