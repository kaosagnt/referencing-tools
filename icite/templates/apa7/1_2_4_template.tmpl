<strong>REFERENCE LIST ENTRY</strong>
<br>
<br>
Add a reference list at the end of your essay citing all sources used in the body of your writing.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	Authors. (Year of publication). Title of article. <em>Name of Journal, volume</em>(issue), 
	page numbers. DOI (if assigned)
</blockquote>
<br>
For works without a DOI, if the work was accessed from a website (excluding online academic research 
databases, e.g., ProQuest, EBSCO and ScienceDirect) include the URL in the reference. Works accessed 
from an academic database do not require a URL or detail about the database in the reference list. In 
this case, the work would be referenced in the same manner as a print version of the work. URLs and DOIs 
are displayed as a hyperlink.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong>
<br>
<blockquote class="ref-hang-indent double-line-spacing">
	<span class="hover" title="Authors">Smith, A., Brown, B., &amp; Chan, C.</span> 
	(<span class="hover" title="Year of publication">2017</span>). 
	<span class="hover" title="Title of article">Thinking critically in a whole new world</span>. 
	<em><span class="hover" title="Name of Jornal">Language Learning in Higher Education</span>, 
	<span class="hover" title="volume">24</span></em>(<span class="hover" title="issue">1</span>), 
	<span class="hover" title="page numbers">67&#45;87</span>. 
	<span class="hover fake-aref" title="DOI">https://doi.org/10.12:3456789012</span>
</blockquote>
<br>
URLs and DOIs are displayed as a hyperlink.
<br>
<br>
If the source displays the DOI number only (e.g., 10.1036/0071393756), convert the DOI into a link 
by adding <span class="fake-aref">https://doi.org/</span> before the number.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
When a work has three to twenty authors, provide the name of the first author followed by the 
abbreviation et al. (note the full stop after et al.).
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith et al. (2017) found that&hellip;
	<br>
	Alternatively: A recent study (Smith et al., 2017) found that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
When the author is referred to more than once, in the same paragraph, cite the work the first time 
that it is referred to in your writing. Once the work is cited, it is not necessary to include the 
citation again, as long as it is clear that you are referring to the same work and that it cannot 
be confused with other sources being paraphrased. Repeat the citation again, if the paraphrase 
continues into the next paragraph.  
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent study, Smith et al. (2017) showed that&hellip; Smith et al. also found 
	that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
If you are using a direct quotation, consisting of fewer than 40 words, enclose the quote using 
double quotation marks and include page numbers.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Smith et al. (2017) observe that &#34;students were learning faster in groups&#34; (p. 92).
	<br>
	Alternatively: So generally, &#34;students were learning faster in groups&#34; 
	(Smith et al., 2017, p. 92).
</blockquote>
<br>
If the quotation is greater than 40 words, the quote is displayed in a double spaced, indented 
block at 1.27cm from the left margin. Do not use double quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
