Avoid where possible!

It is better to refer back to the original source yourself so you can check the accuracy of the 
quoted material. If the original source is unavailable, use <strong>as cited in</strong>. The 
original authors are named in your text, but only the source you actually read goes in the 
reference list. For example, if a study by Jones and Chan was quoted in a work that you read by 
Smith, you would only list Smith in your reference list.

<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>
<br>
<br>
Name the original authors and use &#8216;as cited in&#8217; to refer to the secondary work you read. 
For example, a study by Jones and Chan was quoted in a work by Smith, but you did not read the 
study by Jones and Chan.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	Jones and Chan (as cited in Smith, 2056) indicated that&hellip;
