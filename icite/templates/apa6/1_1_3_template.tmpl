<strong>IN&#45;TEXT CITATION</strong>

	<br>
	Alternatively: A recent study (Smith &amp; Brown, 2056) showed that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>
When the authors are referred to more than once in the same paragraph do not include the date in 
subsequent references, as long as the work cannot be confused with others cited.
<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">
	In a recent study, Smith and Brown (2056) showed that&hellip; Smith and Brown also found 
	that&hellip;
</blockquote>
<br>

<br>
<blockquote class="in-text-citation">

	<br>
	Alternatively: In terms of sustainability, &#34;our dependency on oil is a growing concern&#34;
