	<strong>THE PRIVACY ACT</strong>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Cooper maintained that there comes a time in the life of most individuals when the need for personal 
space or privacy becomes an important issue.<sup>1</sup> Otto and Brown concurred, referring to the 
Taog Niatnuom mountain dwellers in the highlands of New Guinea, who have developed a set of strategies 
for encouraging their offspring to develop individualism.<sup>2</sup> Tait elaborated: &#34;local 
haunts are earmarked for the particular and personal use of their kids.&#34;<sup>3</sup> However, 
where some societies organise initiation ceremonies involving mutilation and dismemberment of 
bodily organs,<sup>4</sup> the Taog Niatnuom progeny, upon reaching puberty, are allotted their 
own special places for the storage of treasures and the whispering of secrets.<sup>5</sup> These 
storage compounds have revealed to archaeologists a minefield of long&#45;forgotten follies, 
enabling the systematic and chronological development of the Taog Niatnuom to be scientifically 
analysed from infancy through adolescence to adulthood.<sup>6</sup>

In contrast, Smith commented that in more westernised societies, the privacy of progeny is a taboo 
issue: parents reject the idea of their kids harbouring secret devices and desires seeing these as 
a threat, a danger to family stability or even universal democracy.<sup>7</sup> Some parents have been 
known to read cherished diaries hidden under mattresses, or follow up trails of unaccountable periodic 
disappearances into the realms of phantasia.<sup>8</sup> Upton and Brown agreed and provided the example 
of Doug who resided with his family in a green and leafy suburb in a far&#45;flung colonial outpost. 
Doug&#8217;s journey through adolescence manifested itself in an obsessive desire, indeed almost disorder, 
for the closeting of his innermost secrets and stashes; a behavioural trait that was thwarted by his 
parents and three older brothers.<sup>9</sup> In a similar scenario, another mother, infuriated by the 
frantic and constant digging up of her precious snapdragons in the front garden, acknowledged 
&#34;By the judicious use of slingshots and catapults I eventually forced the cheeky puppy into burying 
his bones in the laundry under the enormous piles of dirty washing.&#34;<sup>10</sup>
